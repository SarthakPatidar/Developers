# Developers
An Hackathon Project developed by a team of 4 in which the Back-end was coded by me using technologies such as nodeJS, expressJS, mongoDB,  socket.io , jquery. This project aims to link your aadhar card which is an unique identity of every Indian with the HealthCare System and automatically takes the patient details by scanning your aadhar card. Post request is made to our website https://medieasy.herokuapp.com which submits all the details which further is saved into our mlab Database and the next time patient comes, He only needs to enter his phone no. and recieved otp to verify himself.

We also generate a detailed PDF report of what symptoms , disease and medicines the doctor prescribed and thus there exists a central database for every doctor throughout the country which makes easier for doctors to understand the new patients coming for checkup and also see their previous diseases as well as the doctor who treated , his profiles and the medicines which he recommed to patient.

Thus it brings out a better empowerment in the feild of Medicines and HealthCare Management Systems.
